# Slack webhook action

A GitHub Action which uses [Incoming WebHooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) to send messages to slack channels.

## Inputs

### `slack_web_hook_url`

**Required** The URL from Slack for the [Incoming WebHook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

### `slack_json`

**Required** You can use the [Slack Block Kit Builder](https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder) to build your own message.
Just put this JSON into this input. You can use `{{placeholders}}` for more information.

#### `{{placeholders}}`

For example use `{{GITHUB_ACTOR}}` inside your`slack_json` input to show the username of the person who started the action.

You can use all this `{{placeholders}}`:

### `slack_mention_mapping_file`

**Optional** Path to a file which maps the GitHub Names or `@mentions` to Slack `@mentions` (e.g. `slack_mention_mapping_file: ../.github/slack-name-mapping.json`).

> You need to go one dir up to be in your main directory

The file should look like:

```json
{
  "john-smith": {
    "slackId": "1234465",
    "mentions": ["john", "johnSmith", "john-smith"]
  }
}
```

Where

- **john-smith** is the GitHub Username,
- **slackId** is the ID of the Slack-Account of this GitHub User (more here: https://api.slack.com/reference/surfaces/formatting#mentioning-users),
- **mentions** an Array of Strings which are used to replace e.g. `@johnSmith` with a real Slack `@Mention`, it's case insensitive.

## Outputs
